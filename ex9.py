# Here's some new strange stuff, remember to type it exactly.

# assigning a string of the days of the week to "days"

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"

# the \n formats the string so that it begins on the following line as opposed to continuing in the same lines


months = "\nJan\nFen\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

#prints a string and calls for the "days" variable

print("Here are the days: ", days)

#same but for the "months" variable

print("here are the months: ", months)

#the triple quotation marks allows for one to write as many lines of string as they wish as opposed to the previous ex7.py which required constant quations of the strings and commas in between the strings. a useful tool for printing lots of verbage

print("""
There's something going on here
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
""")

#NICE!
